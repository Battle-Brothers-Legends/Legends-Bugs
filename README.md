# Legends-Bugs
Because of the legal gray area around redistributing uncompiled Legends files, we are currently unable to make our main repository public.\
Instead we can use this repository to report and track bugs, check development/update status and generally get an idea for what's happening in the development oven right now.

If you enjoy chatting about Battle Brothers and the Legends Mod, receive fast bug support and have access to our collection of submods - join the [Official Legends Mod Discord](https://discord.gg/a9MmzEDhE8).
